# Express-Validator-NodeJs 
## Description
This is a simple Node.js project using Express.js and Express-Validator for validating user input data in a registration form. The project demonstrates how to set up server-side validation using Express-Validator middleware to ensure that user-provided data meets certain criteria before processing it further. In this project, we validate the username, password, email, and phone number fields of a registration form.
